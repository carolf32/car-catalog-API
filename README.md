# ðŸš— Car catalog API

Made with Typescript and Express's framework. For class relationships, I used dependency injections using the Tsyringe library. Validations and serializations were made with Zod library.

### Each car should be composed by:
|key|type|required?|
|---|----|---------|
|id | primary key | uuid|
|name | text | required|
|description | text | required|
|brand | text | required|
|year | number | required|
|km | number | required|

### Routes:
|route|purpose|
|-----|-------|
|POST /cars | Car insertion route|
|GET /cars | Reading all cars route|
|GET /cars/:id | Individual car reading route|
|PATCH /cars/:id | Updating car route|
|DELETE /cars/:id | Deleting car route|

### Expected behavior:
#### POST/CARS 
#### Body pattern
```
{
    "name": "Car name",
    "description": "Car description",
    "brand": "Card brand",
    "year": 2023,
